For my project, I will be discussing and explaining common attack vectors and exploits that bad-actors can utilize and the 
many ways to avoid falling victim and protecting yourself from them through the use of software installations and configurations.
To demonstrate common vulnerabilities in systems and servers, I will be using a hypervisor to simulate multiple different
 environments and scenarios in order to describe and demonstrate specific attack vectors and vulnerabilities and how they can be fixed and avoided.
